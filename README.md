# Calculator

This is a basic calculator app built in android studio.

To run, download android studio, import project, and set up either a virtual device or plug in your own android device to run the program for testing purposes.

The goal of this program is for me, as a student, to use this calculator to complete science and math problems that involve basic arithmetic, and exponents.
